We endeavor to unpack these complicated phenomena by focusing on how non-profit driven indie game developers perceive the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for their creative practices. Based on qualitative analysis of 1,540 posts and comments from online forums dedicated to this creative community, we provide early empirical evidence of the potential for generative AI to shape the trajectory of creative technology communities such as non-profit driven indie game developers. These insights may inform future research regarding AI’s impacts on the nature of creative work and the growth of creative workforces in technology, which may also help design future AI technologies to support rather than harm these creative communities."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650889","title":"\"I'm actually going to go and change these passwords\": Analyzing the Usability of Credential Audit Interfaces in Password Managers","abstract":"Credential audit interfaces in password managers play a crucial role in enhancing user security by identifying weak, reused, or exposed passwords.

Current Human-Centered Design (HCD) approaches lack the flexibility, volatility and openness to accommodate the new requirements of a highly demanding intelligent digital reality, like randomness, uncertainty, multi-purpose dynamic interactions, adaptability, data-driven design and decision-making, etc. In this respect, this paper (a) embraces an alternative Quantum User Experience theoretical stance – by creating parallels to the fields of (Quantum) Physics, to facilitate the understanding of HCI phenomena in a blended digital-physical ecosystem; and (b) proposes a Human-AI Quantum Experience Design Paradigm that focuses on the dynamics generated by the respective micro- and macro-experiences. Accordingly, the 5 phases: Explore. Define. Engineer. Transform. Adopt., are outlined and brought into perspective of an extended HCD scope.

Moreover, we developed a mathematical model that dynamically quantifies memory consolidation, considering factors such as contextual relevance, elapsed time, and recall frequency. The agent stores memories retrieved from the user’s interaction history in a database that encapsulates each memory’s content and temporal context.

In this work, we surveyed 51 experienced industry professionals to understand the range of scenarios and motivations driving the need for output constraints from a user-centered perspective. We identified 134 concrete use cases for constraints at two levels: low-level, which ensures the output adhere to a structured format and an appropriate length, and high-level, which requires the output to follow semantic and stylistic guidelines without hallucination. Critically, applying output constraints could not only streamline the currently repetitive process of developing, testing, and integrating LLM prompts for developers, but also enhance the user experience of LLM-powered features and applications.

This tool can benefit different areas of application, such as virtual visits to museums, training simulations and emergency scenarios. As a use case in this paper, we address virtual apartment tours. This study demonstrates the potential for more user-centric and accessible VR solutions, contributing to delivering more meaningful experiences in daily and professional settings. To assess the viability and potential applications of our approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers. These interviews yielded insights into practical applications, identified usability challenges, and suggested strategies to enhance user experience."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650969","title":"Addressing the Technology Learning Divide Using Co-Learning with Familiarization Method","abstract":"Empowerment of low-literate women and marginalized communities through learning technology is emphasized by researchers. Co-learning techniques using familiarization methods can effectively help low-tech literate people learn technology, which is underexplored. This pilot study was conducted in two phases. Phase-I explored technology’s learning and adaptation strategies with a qualitative study, where the researcher considered N=36 female participants in urban and rural regions of 3 major divisions of Bangladesh. Phase-II was conducted N=16 (Parent=8, Children=8) participants in Dhaka division urban and rural settings with a series of workshops to understand the impact, opportunities, and challenges of co-learning and familiarization methods in terms of learning technology. Findings show that technology co-learning with familiarization methods greatly aids low-literate women in adopting and pursuing technology rapidly.

However, an excessive amount of explanation can lead to cognitive overload in users and the development of inappropriate trust in AI. To explore the appropriate amount of explanation, this study investigated the effects of explanation type (AI attention heatmap, AI goal, and AI reliability) on trust in XAI for a traditional visual search task in Experiment 1, and the effects of presenting adjusted explanations on task performance for an applied task in Experiment 2. As a result, displaying AI results alone increased trust and task performance for a low-complexity task, and displaying AI results with AI attention heatmaps that have high interpretability increased trust and task performance for a high-complexity task. This study demonstrated the importance of adjusting the amount of AI explanation to develop trust appropriately and improve task performance."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650895","title":"Advancing 3D CAD with Workflow Graph-Driven Bayesian Command Inferences","abstract":"Advancements in 3D generative AI have significantly improved design capabilities, particularly for creating 3D objects and environments. However, the focus of Generative AI on mesh-based models limits opportunities for detailed modifications. Accurate and complex 3D modeling is crucial for manufacturing, which requires high precision and considerable mental effort. This complexity often leads to variability in efficiency among designers, with some employing faster and more accurate techniques and others using less efficient workflows. This variation undergoes the need to optimize modeling sequences. By inferring a user’s intended designs, tailored commands and sequences can be suggested to enhance the precision of 3D modeling. Addressing this, we propose a system that predicts user modeling steps using an inference model based on behavior, thereby promoting efficient workflow and precise command usage. User studies demonstrate that our system minimizes modeling errors, streamlines processes, and offers recommendations for effective command usage."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650868","title":"Advancing Knowledge Together: Integrating Large Language Model-based Conversational AI in Small Group Collaborative Learning","abstract":"In today’s educational landscape, students learn collaboratively, where students benefit from both peer interactions and facilitator guidance. Prior research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) has explored chatbots and AI techniques to aid such collaboration. However, these methods often depend on predefined dialogues (which limits adaptability), are not based on collaborative learning theories, and do not fully recognize the learning context. In this paper, we introduce an Large Language Model (LLM)-powered conversational AI, designed to enhance small group learning through its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. We detail the iterative design process, final design, and implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the bot performs as designed but points to considerations in the timing of interventions and bot’s role in discussions. The evaluation also reveals that learners perceive the bot’s tone and behavior as important for engagement.

Using a PM is often not enough however, especially if users store passwords that are guessable, or have been breached. To assist users in updating insecure passwords, PMs come with “checkup\" features that report the strength of users’ passwords. However, there has yet to be a systematic study of the features offered as part of these checkups, and the consistency of the checkup advice across different PMs. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary analysis of 14 PMs’ password checkup features, recording how many passwords are reported weak and compromised. We find that many PMs fail to report breached credentials. Weak passwords were also under-reported by PMs. This analysis forms the basis for a larger study on the consistencies of PM checkup tools and how users perceive and use them."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650854","title":"An Article a Day: Towards Personal Informatics for Healthy News Consumption","abstract":"Technological logs can enable us to self-reflect on our habits through data.

Thus, haptic designers often use a trial-and-error process with different parameter combinations to obtain desired tactile patterns (i.e., Tactons) for user applications. We propose an interactive tool with five temporal and three spatiotemporal design parameters that can simulate the temporal and spectral properties of stimulation at specific skin points. As a preliminary verification, we measured vibrations induced from the ultrasound Tactons varying on one temporal and two spatiotemporal parameters.

Since weather patterns undergo long-term changes, elders’ phenological knowledge and everyday experiences can offer valuable insights. Nonetheless, these insights need to be adequately represented in sustainability discussions. We present the research-through-design process behind PhenoProbe, an interview tool that employs a series of cards inspired by the 24 solar terms. PhenoProbe incorporates Taiwanese seasonal soundscapes with surreal visuals generated through proverb prompts to cultivate meaningful conversations between elders and researchers. The tool is crafted to encourage elders to comfortably engage in and reflect upon their daily weather-related experiences. Our work delivers two main contributions: 1) A tool that engages elders in discussions about phenological patterns and embodied experiences, and 2) An approach that weaves familiar cultural elements into open-ended elicitation materials, fostering the involvement of older adults in the design process."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650819","title":"Designing Shared VR Tools for Spatial Scientific Sensemaking About Wildfire Evacuation","abstract":"We posit that scientists who work with spatial data could benefit from shared VR tools that allow them to do immersive sensemaking together to generate new insights and approaches to their work.

Yet, digital documents are still commonly signed using (copies of) handwritten signatures, which are sensitive to fraud. Though secure, cryptography-based signature solutions exist, they are hardly used due to usability issues. This paper proposes to use digital identity wallets for securely and intuitively signing digital documents with verified personal data. Using expert feedback, we implemented this vision in an interactive prototype. The prototype was assessed in a moderated usability test (N = 15) and a subsequent unmoderated remote usability test (N = 99). While participants generally expressed satisfaction with the system, they also misunderstood how to interpret the signature information displayed by the prototype. Specifically, signed documents were also trusted when the document was signed with irrelevant personal data of the signer.

This study investigates crowdsourcing’s potential to predict pedestrian behavioral intentions. We recruited 120 participants to predict pedestrian intentions at different prediction horizons in 24 diverse videos. Our findings revealed that the status-quo bias significantly impacts intention estimation. Specifically, when asked what status the pedestrian will be, predictions inclined towards current state’s continuation over transition, with an overall accuracy of 53% at one-second prediction length on a balanced dataset. Rephrasing the annotation question mitigates this bias and improved the estimation accuracy to 79% for one-second ahead predictions, though accuracy drops with longer horizons and is affected by pedestrian actions and contextual information. Overall, this study provides insights into the factors affecting collective estimation of pedestrian intentions and aims to improve crowdsourcing cognitive labels for training better AV-pedestrian interaction algorithms."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650859","title":"Exploring Design Approaches for Reducing Viewers' Discomfort with Distressing Short-form Videos","abstract":"The growing popularity of short-form video platforms and their reliance on algorithmic recommendations highlights the risk of viewers unintentionally encountering distressing content. Therefore, we investigated viewers’ experiences with distressing content and developed design approaches to alleviate their discomfort. Through in-depth interviews, we discovered that participants perceived and reacted differently to “socially inappropriate content,” which violated societal norms, and to “personally discomforting content,” which triggered negative reactions on a personal level. Further, participants expressed frustration with the lack of transparency in content reporting processes, the challenges in tailoring recommendation algorithms to avoid distressing content, and the limitations of post-exposure feedback mechanisms. To address these challenges, we conceptualized three design approaches focused on enhancing reporting process transparency, providing users with granular control over content recommendations, and allowing for preemptive adjustments to their content feeds. Our findings and proposed design approaches may provide valuable directions for improving viewer well-being on short-form video platforms."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650911","title":"Exploring Effective Real-Time Ergonomic Guidance Methods for Immersive Virtual Reality Workspace","abstract":"Studying and working in Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive experience and enables free body movement for input.

However, relatively low acceptance in clinical practice demonstrates the challenge of incorporating end-users’ lived experience and their opinions to improve the interaction between clinicians and AI solutions. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with radiologists and technicians who had lived experience with current or the prior generations of radiology AI tools (e.g., Computer Aided Decision tools). Three key themes were elicited. Firstly, the role of AI, addresses how radiology professionals interact with radiology AI; the second theme, adoption in practice, discusses the requirements for easy usage and smooth transition; the third theme, building appropriate trust, explores influencing factors of clinicians’ trust towards radiology AI. Our findings call attention to the adoption of actionable recommendations on the interaction design and the importance of individual tailored functionalities in radiology AI systems."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650765","title":"From Ideas to Impact: Cracking the Code for Effectively Engaging Teens in Long-Term Online Safety Research","abstract":"We solicited feedback from seven teens (aged 15-17) after they served for approximately two years on a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) for online safety.

Hence, they face challenges in scalability, engagement, and effectiveness, as some learners might struggle to relate to the examples or find them relevant. To address these challenges, we introduce GELEX (GEnerative-AI Learning through EXamples), a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) system enhancing example-based learning by using large language models (LLMs). Our hybrid system incorporates mechanisms to control and evaluate the AI output, acknowledging and addressing the potential factual inaccuracies of LLMs. We instantiate our system in the cooking domain. Our approach utilizes association rule mining on a large database of recipes to identify key patterns. When learners submit a recipe for feedback, a LLM enriches it by integrating these patterns. Then, learners are prompted to actively process the example by highlighting the changes and critically assessing the modifications. This strategy transforms traditional example-based learning into a dynamic, scalable, interactive educational tool."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650817","title":"GHOJA: Human-in-the-Loop Joint Pose Optimization based on Geometric Constraint and Human Common-sense","abstract":"Assigning a motion to movable parts in 3D scanned objects is important for various applications, such as virtual reality and robotics simulation.

Users had to execute sorting and dispatch tasks in collaboration with a virtual cobot. The degree of social gestalt of the cobot was varied by the ability to make small talk (i.e., talkative vs. non-talkative cobot), and the task load was increased by adding a secondary task (i.e., high vs. low task load condition). Overall, the talkative cobot led to a more positive perception of the cobot and increased social qualities like sense of meaning and team membership compared to the non-talkative cobot. The following gender effect was particularly interesting. The talkative cobot had a buffering effect for women and a distraction conflict effect for men in high task load conditions. When interacting with the talkative robot, women find the high task condition less stressful. In contrast thereto, the talkative cobot was distracting for men in the high task load condition. Our results highlight that social design choices and interindividual differences influence a successful collaboration between humans and AI. The work also shows the added value of systematic XR-simulations for the investigation and design of human-centered HAIIs (eXtended AI approach)."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650860","title":"Generating personas using LLMs and assessing their viability","abstract":"User personas, reflecting human characteristics, play a crucial role in human-centered design, contributing significantly to ideation and product design processes.

For empowered citizenship and career readiness, elementary and middle school students need to understand these technologies. To provide engaging introductory experiences, we created five original interactive software exhibits introducing children to hands-on activities in AI and ML. The exhibits were tested by 125 elementary and middle school students (aged 7 to 14). Four themes emerged: Students recognized that AI and ML systems can process data from cameras (perception); they saw that these systems responded to their training input (trust); they appreciated the practical import of AI/ML systems (affective and cognitive attitudes); and students were introduced to models and modes (specialization). This paper presents our goals in creating the exhibits and results from our initial testing with children.

There are more than 55 million persons living with dementia (PLwDs) globally with 10 million new cases annually. Dementia is characterized by declining cognitive and functional abilities over time. This can lead to serious challenges in financial decision-making and stability for PLwDs. Care partners are often required to undertake financial management responsibilities on behalf of PLwDs. In this preliminary work, we explore the needs and challenges for care partners in managing the finances of PLwDs. We interviewed (N=7) care partners for individuals with mild to severe dementia. We describe our initial findings on the emotional challenges for care partners, the transition of their financial responsibilities over time, and the need for preemptive planning and different collaborative financial management support throughout the course of the illness. These findings can inform accessible and supportive financial technology design for PLwDs and their care partners."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650745","title":"Mappings in the Home: Selecting Home Appliances in 3D Space","abstract":"Unlike voice assistants, remotes, and smartphones, UIs embedded into furniture and other surfaces offer silent, discreet, and unobtrusive control of smart home appliances. However, as the number of appliances grows, fitting individual controls for each onto the surfaces in our environment becomes impractical, making it necessary to select appliances before controlling them. These appliances are placed in 3D at various heights around the room, while traditional controls are laid out in 2D, complicating control-to-target mapping. We compared six UIs using mappings with spatial analogies that are either absolute or relative to the user’s position and perspective. Participants used each to select 20 targets in a simplified living room, once while looking and once eyes-free. We investigated performance and participants’ ratings for, inter alia, ease of use, mapping comprehensibility, and mental demand. Map-based controllers were most promising, but participants also ranked perspective projection with touch input highly."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650872","title":"MeMic: Towards Social Acceptability of User-Only Speech Recording Wearables","abstract":"Wearables that record audio continuously have various applications such as health monitoring and cognitive augmentation. However, they raise serious privacy concerns amongst bystanders and conversation partners, reducing their social acceptability. To address this, we designed the MeMic, a wearable that records audio only when the user speaks, driven by a hardware-based voice activity detector. A visible light on the wearable indicates when it is actively recording to enhance trust for others. We validate its performance with participants (N=12) wearing the MeMic and performing tasks. Further, an online study (N=168) compared the social acceptability of the MeMic’s self-recording paradigm versus continuous recording. We find significantly less social fears alongside reduced privacy concerns in the self-recording paradigm, thereby improving social acceptability. We also explore different conceptual form factors (glasses, pendant necklace, and behind-the-neck) for the MeMic and find that the pendant necklace is the most preferred. This work contributes towards enhancing the social comfort of wearables that continuously capture users’ speech."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650807","title":"Might as Well Be on Mars: Insights on the Extraterrestrial Applicability of Interaction Design Frameworks from Earth","abstract":"As humanity expands its reach into the Cosmos, the imagination-sparkling prospect of colonizing other planets, such as Mars, becomes increasingly tangible.

The use of virtual data can improve the robustness, effective features, and customized motion types chosen in the HAR system. However, few studies have focused on augmenting virtual IMU data to reduce the dependence on real IMU data during the machine learning model training phase. This work proposes modifying the reconstructed 3D motion by its joint data to generate larger 3D motion based on a given 3D motion sequence, thus augmenting the virtual IMU dataset. The method simulates the intra-difference of the same motion type in the real world.

However, their form factor presents challenges in integrating input channels, such as buttons, leading to difficulties in menu selection and mode switching—functions essential for complex tasks. In this paper, we explored the utilization of air pressure to augment the input capabilities of spherical devices. We implemented linear menu selection using a pressure-sensitive spherical tangible device and evaluated its performance through three menu selection techniques: Dwell, Quick Release, and Stroke. Our results indicated that participants achieved an average success rate of 97.6% and an average selection time of 1,449 ms across all selection techniques for the 12 menu items. Dwell showed higher accuracy, while Quick Release and Stroke showed faster selection times. Lastly, we demonstrated the application of performing various tasks such as object manipulation, locomotion, and text input in a virtual reality environment using a spherical tangible device through pressure-based menu selection."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650959","title":"Promoting Cognitive Health in Older Adults through an Exercise Game Centered around Foreign Language Learning","abstract":"Aging is a primary contributor to cognitive decline. Existing research demonstrates that Aerobic Exercise (AE) induces significant functional neuroplasticity changes, enhancing cognitive function. Foreign language learning (FLL) also positively impacts cognitive health and may offer resistance to age-related cognitive decline. Addressing the gap in studying the combined effects of AE and FLL on cognitive benefits, we designed an intervention using a screen-based virtual biking tour to enhance cognitive health in older adults. Our project investigates whether the simultaneous integration of AE and FLL yields superior cognitive and language learning outcomes compared to FLL learning alone. In a preliminary analysis with a small sample, we observed significantly improved Spanish language learning outcomes in both combined physical and language learning groups.

However, the design and fabrication process of origami is labor-intensive, and building circuits on it is often unstable as they can easily be broken during iterative folding processes. We propose a fabrication method that helps users quickly design and fabricate haptic origami interfaces with electric sensing. By extending the previous 4D printing method [16], we developed a design software that can generate both a pattern of self-foldable shape and a pattern of circuitry. In the software, two kirigami hinges and five shape modules are available for users. Kirigami hinges protect the circuits from damage and achieve deformation sensing during the iterative folding process. Five shape modules have different haptic capabilities for different use cases.

As the adoption of digital interactions in HIV care via mobile health (mHealth) tools is emerging, maintaining rapport in these asynchronous text-based communications becomes a critical yet challenging task. In this paper, we analyze 1,740 messages from an mHealth platform, categorized by experienced clinicians as either ‘rapport-building’ or ‘information-only.’ We utilize linguistic analysis to uncover key attributes of rapport-building communication. This led to a set of machine learning (ML) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of classifying these communication styles. Further, we propose the application of LLMs not only to identify but also to actively rewrite ‘information only’ messages into versions that enhance rapport building without compromising information integrity. Our research demonstrates potential advancements in HIV mHealth communication by integrating linguistic analysis with language models, leading to more effective patient-provider interactions."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650916","title":"Read the Fine Print: Assessing the User Experience of Reading in High Resolution Virtual Reality","abstract":"Despite the increasing visual fidelity of commercially available virtual reality (VR) headsets, they remain ill-suited to scenarios that require reading large quantities of text.

However, toxicity scoring may render pertinent information inaccessible, rigidify or “value-lock” cultural norms, and prevent language reclamation processes, particularly for marginalized people. In this work, we extend the concept of algorithmic recourse to generative language models: we provide users a novel mechanism to achieve their desired prediction by dynamically setting thresholds for toxicity filtering. Users thereby exercise increased agency relative to interactions with the baseline system. A pilot study (n = 30) supports the potential of our proposed recourse mechanism, indicating improvements in usability compared to fixed-threshold toxicity-filtering of model outputs. Future work should explore the intersection of toxicity scoring, model controllability, user agency, and language reclamation processes—particularly with regard to the bias that many communities encounter when interacting with generative language models."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650964","title":"Revealing the Challenges to Automation Adoption in Organizations: Examining Practitioner Perspectives From an International Airport","abstract":"Sustained adoption of automation is a problem for organizations, despite the promised benefits of automation and the propensity for organizations to expect it to transform their workplaces.

With an online experiment, we quantitatively assess updates in norm beliefs regarding human-robot prosocial behaviors through observational learning. Results demonstrate the initially perceived normativity of helping robots is influenced by familiarity with delivery robots and perceptions of robots’ social intelligence. Observing human-robot prosocial interactions notably shifts peoples’ normative beliefs about prosocial actions; thereby changing their perceived obligations to offer help to delivery robots. Additionally, we found that observing robots offering help to humans, rather than receiving help, more significantly increased participants’ feelings of obligation to help robots.

Assembling characters in 2D games is a common practice with a significant demand for creativity, yet the creation process remains challenging, confined to professional graphic designers and animators. Traditional automated character creation in games usually involves manual parameter adjustment or the use of photos as references, coupled with the selection of pre-set backgrounds or professions within the game, leading to limitations in terms of freedom, usability, and consistency. However, with advancements in natural language processing, large language models (LLMs), and generative AI, we have the opportunity to reimagine the process of user-interactive character creation. This paper introduces a novel text-to-character methodology, integrating LLM technology with generative image AI, eliminating the need for reference photos or manual parameter editing while providing extensive options for character creation. Through natural language processing and automated skeletal animation, the generated 2D characters are capable of being driven across various web platforms and game engines. This exploration aims to establish a framework for driven agents that harmonizes the visual layer with linguistic personality, thereby providing a more enriched user experience in games and other applications as agents."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650919","title":"The Arizona Water Chatbot: Helping Residents Navigate a Water Uncertain Future One Response at a Time","abstract":"The Southwestern US is a water-scarce region experiencing a megadrought more exceptional than any in the past 1200 years.

Through qualitative analysis of 19 semi-structured interviews with members of the MidJourney community, a text-to-image generative AI tool, we identify four socio-engagement themes: proprietary/solitary, derivative, collaborative, and provocative prompting. These themes reveal a space of social engagement modes based on personal values and motivations from individual exploration to influencing the prompt community and highlight a fine line between being inspired by others’ prompts and maintaining creative ownership. We argue that understanding distinct social engagement preferences can inform the design of AI tools to facilitate transparent prompt reuse mechanisms, integrate collaborative features, or preserve ethical concerns about prompt sharing."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650997","title":"Theorizing Deception: A Scoping Review of Theory in Research on Dark Patterns and Deceptive Design","abstract":"The issue of dark patterns and deceptive designs (DPs) in everyday interfaces and interactions continues to grow.

In this essay, we first discuss the potential tension between relatedness and autonomy. We then present five previously published relatedness technologies as examples of how neglecting autonomy might lead to unexpected side effects or the absence of positive effects. We suggest that designing for relatedness should be understood as designing for the ongoing negotiation of relatedness (the “we”) and autonomy (the “I”).

Due to the imperfections of automatic speech recognition, there remains conversational difficulties for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals when conversing with hearing individuals. For instance, hearing conversation partners may often not realize that their Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing conversation partner is missing parts of the conversation. This study examines whether providing visual feedback of captioned conversation to hearing conversation partners can enhance conversational accuracy and dynamics. Through a task-based experiment involving 20 hearing participants we measure the impact on visual feedback of captioning on error rates, self-corrections, and subjective workloads. Our findings indicate that when given visual feedback, the average number of errors made by participants was 1.15 less (p = 0.00258) indicating a notable reduction in errors. When visual feedback is provided, the average number of self-corrections increased by 3.15 (p < 0.001), suggesting a smoother and more streamlined conversation These results show that the inclusion of visual feedback in conversation with a Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individual can lead to improved conversational efficiency."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650888","title":"Towards Lenses for Reviewing Playfulness in HCI","abstract":"From playful design methods to artifacts that facilitate experiences of play, playfulness has been widely explored in HCI.

Augmented Reality (AR) applications have been increasingly used to present geodata visualizations in their innate three-dimensional format to support Earth Science learning. However, little is known about how student groups naturally collaborate around AR applications to interpret and make sense of geodata visualizations. To bridge this gap, we studied how groups of pre-service Earth Science teachers collaboratively explored a mobile AR application showcasing Earth's ocean system. In our findings of groups’ natural collaboration behaviors, we found that most groups tended to work closely where both group members talked about content and interacted with the AR app together. Our findings will inform the design of future mobile-AR geospatial data visualization interfaces to effectively support collaborative learning in classrooms."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3651019","title":"Towards a Safer Digital Future: Exploring Stakeholder Perspectives on Creating a Sustainable Youth Online Safety Community","abstract":"In this study, we synthesize insights from secondary stakeholders (i.e., IT professionals, teachers, and entrepreneurs) in youth online safety regarding the use of online community platforms to raise awareness, and their effectiveness in sponsoring community engagement for developing youth online safety solutions.

With this technique, a trained Communication and Regulation Partner (CRP) holds a plastic letterboard and reads aloud the letters an individual is pointing toward. Training to communicate in this manner is typically a lengthy process and the cost and availability of a professional CRP can be a limiting factor to an individual’s ability to progress. To address this problem, we build a system that allows an individual to wear an Augmented Reality (AR) headset and engage in spelling exercises on a holographic letterboard supported by a fully embodied, virtual CRP. Specifically, we video recorded 20-minute spelling sessions collected from 13 participants and coded these videos to understand the nature of interactions between a user and their CRP. Later, we use the coded data to derive a Markov decision process behaviour model that allows the virtual CRP (ViC) to mimic a real CRP. Our preliminary results show that ViC can achieve an accuracy of up to 68% even with the limited data we were able to collect and the simplified modeling approach we used. Thus, our work opens doors for nonspeakers to practice various aspects of spelling-based communication in the absence of a human CRP, thereby fostering increased independence and privacy."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3651021","title":"Towards an Evaluation Framework for Extended Reality Authentication Schemes","abstract":"Over the years, one of the biggest challenges for researchers has been to propose authentication schemes that will be both usable and secure and will ensure user’s privacy.

A Case for Compositional and Contextual Validation of XAI Building Blocks","abstract":"Despite significant progress, evaluation of explainable artificial intelligence remains elusive and challenging. In this paper we propose a fine-grained validation framework that is not overly reliant on any one facet of these sociotechnical systems, and that recognises their inherent modular structure: technical building blocks, user-facing explanatory artefacts and social communication protocols. While we concur that user studies are invaluable in assessing the quality and effectiveness of explanation presentation and delivery strategies from the explainees’ perspective in a particular deployment context, the underlying explanation generation mechanisms require a separate, predominantly algorithmic validation strategy that accounts for the technical and human-centred desiderata of their (numerical) outputs. Such a comprehensive sociotechnical utility-based evaluation framework could allow to systematically reason about the properties and downstream influence of different building blocks from which explainable artificial intelligence systems are composed – accounting for a diverse range of their engineering and social aspects – in view of the anticipated use case."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650871","title":"What Factors Motivate Culturally Deaf People to Want Assistive Technologies?","abstract":"Assistive technologies see high rates of rejection, especially in Deaf communities, due to barriers including cost, discomfort, acclimatization periods, lack of aesthetic appeal, visibility of technology and/or disability, misalignment with user’s identity, loss of independence, self-stigma, social anxiety, social stigma, privacy concerns, surveillance and control of data. To explore what factors might motivate Deaf people to engage with assistive technologies, we interviewed twelve Deaf people about a proposed AI-based assistive technology: a personal assistant device which would understand and respond in Auslan, the sign language of the Australian Deaf community. Thematic analysis of the interview results revealed interviewees would be motivated to use such technology by linguistic and cultural alignment, equality, accessibility and inclusion, independence, life improvements, and aesthetic and technology appeal. We propose these motivating factors should be considered in the development of future assistive technologies, especially those intended for culturally Deaf people."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650804","title":"What Is the User Experience of Eyes-Free Touch Input with Vibrotactile Feedback Decoupled from the Touchscreen?","abstract":"Vibrotactile cues commonly serve as substitutes for visual feedback in eyes-free touch input, yet not all touchscreens have haptic capabilities. In this work, we examine the user experience of arm-localized vibrations delivered away from the touchscreen through a connected wearable. In a controlled experiment, fourteen participants used a touchscreen in eyes-free mode, while receiving single-pulse vibrations on the index finger, wrist, or forearm as confirmatory feedback of their on-screen touches. We reveal a favorable user experience of vibrations decoupled from the touchscreen, characterized by high perceived enjoyment (Mdn=4 on a scale from 1 to 5), efficiency (Mdn=4), integration (Mdn=5), and confidence (Mdn=4) with moderate complexity (Mdn=3) and low perceived distractedness (Mdn=2), difficulty (Mdn=1), and confusion (Mdn=1).

Online video tutorials have often been used for this training in familiar settings. However, video training lacks real-time feedback, affecting training efficacy in contrast with in-person training. In this paper, we propose WheelSkill, a prototype wheelchair training system combining motion capture and a training interface, providing real-time visual feedback based on the user’s skeletal motion. Eight wheelchair users and a wheelchair expert trainer were consulted in a pilot focus group and interview. Results highlight themes of human-centred design principles for wheelchair users for the final iteration of WheelSkills to assimilate for a high-fidelity wheelchair training feedback system. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of WheelSkills and the adaptions planned for future works."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3651094","title":"Where Do You Look When Unlocking Your Phone? : A Field Study of Gaze Behaviour During Smartphone Unlock","abstract":"Eye gaze has emerged as a promising avenue for implicit authentication/identification on smartphones, offering the potential for seamless user identification and two-factor authentication. However, a crucial gap exists in understanding eye gaze behaviour specifically during smartphone unlocks. This lack of understanding is magnified by scenarios where users’ faces are not fully visible in front cameras, leading to inaccurate gaze estimation. In this work, we conducted a 24-hour in-the-wild study tracking 21 users’ eye gaze during smartphone unlocks.

However, the research community has not given comprehensive attention to the eCX, often neglecting interactions between key components: EVs, chargers, and mobile apps. This research addresses the gap by identifying heuristic evaluation criteria to measure the problems of existing EV chargers for effective management. The charging process was analyzed hierarchically to establish criteria, and its relevance to previously established heuristics was evaluated. Domain experts then verified 27 criteria in 7 tasks, whether these can effectively identify issues affecting eCX through ratings and discussions. As a result of quantitative analysis of the ratings and qualitative examination of the discussions, formulated criteria can offer comprehensive and valuable insights spanning various eCX components and tasks.

In a classroom or during on-stage presentation, it is often presenters only who are equipped with MR HMDs. However, since spectators most often outnumber presenters, equipping collocated spectators with HMDs to create a shared immersive experience can be costly. This imbalance can result in inefficient presenter-spectator communication and can reduce spectator engagement. To address the need of viewing MR content in such collocated asymmetric groups, we present a concept called XRPublicSpectator. This system utilizes a large display to present a third-person-view of the MR environment constructed by combining RGB-D data of the physical space obtained from a depth-sensing camera with objects from the same virtual environment as tracked by the MR HMDs. Leveraging the XRPublicSpectator concept, we developed an exemplary application which captivated an MR game arena where non-HMD users can watch players performing a duel card game. Results from a preliminary study with the exemplary application show that compared to the first-person MR view, XRPublicSpectator enabled non-HMD users to more comprehensively perceive information within the MR environment and potentially improved their engagement with HMD users and MR contents."},{"url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3650880","title":"Young Children and ChatGPT: Parents' Use of ChatGPT in Parenting","abstract":"The increased use of LLMs such as ChatGPT introduced new learning opportunities for educators and different age groups of learners in formal education.
